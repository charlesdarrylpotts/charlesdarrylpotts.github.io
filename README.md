THE INTEGRATED AVIAN KINETIC CHAIN: TECHNICAL ADVISORY
Physics-Compliance and Solid-State Mechanosensation
This repository serves as the official record for technical advisories regarding the Avian Furcula as a High-Speed Mechanosensory Organ (HSMCO) and the Avian Flight Neural Conduction Index (AFNCI).
Master Record of Scientific Claims
1. The Thermodynamic Imperative: Current models of avian flight violate physical law by failing to account for mechanical heat dissipation and signal degradation.
2. The Furcula as a Biomechanical Transducer: The avian furcula acts as a tri-axial mechanical transducer and high-speed mechanosensory organ for sub-millisecond flight control.
3. Solid-State Signal Integrity: Bone conduction transmits mechanical waves at approximately 3000 m/s, providing a temporal advantage over myelinated nerve conduction.
4. Cascading Structural Integration: While the synsacrum has been identified as a pelvic accelerometer (Stanchak et al.), I propose it functions as a centralized, high-speed vibrometer processing the vector sum of bilateral forces through the solid-state kinetic chain.
